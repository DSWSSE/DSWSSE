Let's plan to get together.  Maybe you'll come over to our humble little pad
and have a nice home-cooked meal.  Hillary is a really good cook.

I am sorry I didn't invite you to the wedding, Jeff.  I was going to and
then changed my mind when you seemed so stressed and hassled by your
work/travel schedule.  I didn't want you to feel obliged to travel if you
didn't want to.  I should have asked you your preference.  I hope you
understand.

I'm so glad you're okay, relatively speaking.  You're a great guy, Jeff, and
I hope that this experience helps you and me and everybody around us to
focus on what's actually important in our lives, and to be especially kind
to each other.

Please tell me when you're coming around

Warm Regards,
ben
